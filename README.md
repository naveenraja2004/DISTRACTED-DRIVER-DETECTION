#  TITLE : Driver-Distraction-Detection

# Name : Naveen Raja N R

# Small Description about the Project

The Driver Distraction Detection System is designed to monitor and identify unsafe driver behaviors such as face tilt, yawning, drowsiness, and sleeping using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system aims to improve road safety by detecting driver inattention in real time and issuing alerts to prevent accidents.

# About

The Driver Distraction Detection System is a deep learning–based project developed to analyze driver facial features and behaviors to identify distraction and fatigue. Road accidents caused by driver drowsiness and distraction are a major safety concern worldwide. Traditional monitoring systems lack accuracy and real-time responsiveness.

This project addresses these challenges by using a camera-based system that continuously monitors the driver’s face. By detecting conditions such as face tilt, yawning, eye closure, drowsiness, and sleep, the system can determine whether the driver is attentive or distracted. The system is designed to be scalable, efficient, and suitable for real-time deployment in vehicles.
