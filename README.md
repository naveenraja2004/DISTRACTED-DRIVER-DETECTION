# DISTRACTED-DRIVER-DETECTION
Distracted driving is one of the major causes of road accidents worldwide, resulting in significant loss of life and property.
Driver distractions such as using mobile phones, eating, adjusting in-vehicle systems, or lack of attention reduce reaction time and increase the probability of collisions.
This project presents an automated Distracted Driver Detection System that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify and classify driver behavior in real time. 
The proposed system captures video frames from an in-vehicle camera and extracts visual features related to head position, hand movement, and facial expressions.
These features are processed using deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify driver actions into distracted and non-distracted categories.
Upon detecting distraction, the system can generate alerts to warn the driver, thereby improving road safety. 
Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves high accuracy in detecting various forms of driver distraction under different lighting and driving conditions. 
This approach provides an effective solution for enhancing intelligent transportation systems and reducing road accidents caused by inattentive driving.
